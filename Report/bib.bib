  abstract     = {This document describes SPAKE2, which is a protocol for two parties that share a password to derive a strong shared key without disclosing the password. This method is compatible with any group, is computationally efficient, and has a security proof. This document predated the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) competition, and it was not selected; however, given existing use of variants in Kerberos and other applications, it was felt that publication was beneficial. Applications that need a symmetric PAKE, but are unable to hash onto an elliptic curve at execution time, can use SPAKE2. This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group in the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).}

  abstract  = {We present the SIGMA family of key-exchange protocols and the ``SIGn-and-MAc'' approach to authenticated Diffie-Hellman underlying its design. The SIGMA protocols provide perfect forward secrecy via a Diffie-Hellman exchange authenticated with digital signatures, and are specifically designed to ensure sound cryptographic key exchange while providing a variety of features and trade-offs required in practical scenarios (such as optional identity protection and reduced number of protocol rounds). As a consequence, the SIGMA protocols are very well suited for use in actual applications and for standardized key exchange. In particular, SIGMA serves as the cryptographic basis for the signature-based modes of the standardized Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol (version 1 and 2).},
